# Hi! I'm Celeste!
I have 21yo and I love coding since I've 12yo and I live in France 🇫🇷. I'm mostly interested in **web and mobile** developpement. I like do some fun stuff, like **hacking/modding devices**, like transform my Switch to a ubuntu server via **[Switchroot](https://switchroot.org)**, and my 3DS and all my other consoles. I have started to learn the HTML language since I've 9yo if I remember correctly.
